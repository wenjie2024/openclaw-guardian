Tired of waking up to a broken OpenClaw instance?

You configure Telegram, Gateway crashes. You fix the config, another provider hits rate limits. You debug for hours, only to find it was a simple auth error.

Sound familiar?

I built OpenClaw Guardian — a 3-layer self-healing system that:

✅ Auto-recovers from config corruption (rolling backups)
✅ Detects provider cooldowns & failover chains 
✅ Restarts Gateway automatically when it hangs
✅ Sends you audit reports every 2 hours

Day: Health probes every 15 min
Night: Every hour (save tokens)

No more 3am debugging sessions. Your OpenClaw fixes itself.

Built this after one too many "why isn't my bot responding" mornings. 

The pain was real:
- JSON typo → Gateway down → manual SSH 
- Moonshot rate limit → fallback to Gemini → no visibility
- Telegram token expired → silent failures

Guardian watches. Guardian heals. You sleep.

Give it a spin. Feedback welcome — it's beta but battle-tested on my own setup.
