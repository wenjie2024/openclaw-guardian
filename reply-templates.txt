OpenClaw Guardian - Reply Templates
====================================

TEMPLATE 1 - Nader Dabit (Mission Control):
Love this setup! 🚀 For anyone running 10+ agents — consider adding OpenClaw Guardian for self-healing. Auto-recovers when Gateway crashes, detects provider cooldowns. Keeps your Mission Control running 24/7. 🔗 github.com/anchor-jevons/openclaw-guardian

TEMPLATE 2 - Sumanth (Token optimization):
Great comparison! Guardian optimizes token usage with smart day/night scheduling. Layer 1 handles health probes, Layer 2 generates audit reports. Sleep better while your agents work. 🔗 github.com/anchor-jevons/openclaw-guardian

TEMPLATE 3 - Thomas Roccia (Security):
Love MoltThreats! 🔥 Guardian complements this perfectly — production-grade monitoring with auto-recovery. Layer 3 integrates Tinman for security scans. Defense in depth for AI agents. 🔗 github.com/anchor-jevons/openclaw-guardian

TEMPLATE 4 - SANS ISC (Monitoring):
Exactly! Guardian provides production-ready monitoring for OpenClaw. Self-healing watchdog + system audit + optional security integration. Deploy and sleep soundly. 🔗 github.com/anchor-jevons/openclaw-guardian

TEMPLATE 5 - Solana (Ecosystem):
Running agents on Base? Guardian keeps them healthy 24/7. Auto-recovery from config corruption, provider cooldown detection, smart scheduling to optimize costs. 🔗 github.com/anchor-jevons/openclaw-guardian
